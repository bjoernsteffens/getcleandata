# Getting and Cleaning Data

This data product is the result of an exercise in an overall education
programme learning about the daily challenges of working as a data scientist. Information about the project where the data was provided can be found here:

[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The data used for the project was downloaded from here:

[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)


# The Raw Data

The raw data we were asked to analyse and merge can be found in two files

    Training Data:      ./data_raw/X_train.txt
    Training Subject:   ./data_raw/subject_train.txt
    
    Test Data:          ./data_raw/X_test.txt
    Test Sibject:       ./data_raw/subject_test.txt
    
        data_TrainSubject   <- "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
    data_TestSubject    <- "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"

Each file contains a number of observation each having 561 variables. The names of the variables are listed in this file

    Variable Names: features.txt


# The Tidy Data
The data set prepared for further analysis contains 30 observations of 561 numeric
variables and 1 factor column identifying the subject that produced out the test
or the training data set. Each column provides the mean of the larger and merged
test and training data set.

    Training Data:  ./data_tidy/mean_TestTrain.txt


# The Code Book
The analysis code are dependant on these libraries. Please make sure you have installed those before attempting to run the code.

    library(dplyr)          -> install.packages("dplyr")
    library(data.table)     -> install.packages("data.table")

# R Code

The code reads the Training and the Test data sets into two separate data frames. Each dataframe is enriched with a single column holding the variable of the subject that carried out the experiement. This column is used in the tapply function to calcuate the means of each subject.

Note:
Adjust the w_Dir variable 

## Code flow

1. Prepare all the variables used in the code
2. Download the zip file
3. Extract the 561 column names for both test and training data
4. Prepare the test data set and attach the subject column
4. Prepare the training data set and attach the subject column
5. Merge the data sets
6. Use dplyr functions to calculate the means of all 561 variables
7. Save resluts to disk
