# Getting and Cleaning Data

    Introduction to the topic
    with some descriptive text

# The Raw Data

# The Tidy Data


# The Code Book

# R Code

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
run_Analysis <- function () {
    
    library(dplyr)
    library(data.table)
    
    w_Dir           <- "~/mycloud/Private_DataScience/Coursera/10 Data Science Specialisation/20 Getting and Cleaning Data/99 assignment"
    file_Target     <- "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip"
    file_Source     <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
    file_Timestamp  <- "getdata_projectfiles_UCI_download_date.csv"
    data_Training   <- "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
    data_Testing    <- "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
    
    # Position and pull the file
    setwd(w_Dir)
    download.file(file_Source, file_Target, method = "curl")

    # Mark download date
    date_Downloaded = c("Date Downloaded", date())
    write.csv(date_Downloaded, file = file_Timestamp )
    
    # Unzip the file
    unzip("getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip", overwrite = TRUE)

    # use data.table to read the file. 
    # HEADS-UP df_train <- read.csv(data_Training, header = FALSE, sep = " ") 
    # HEADS-UP does not create the necessary structure and says 662|667 colS
    # Inspect the column classes first and pre-load to speed up the larger load
    dt_Training <- fread(data_Training, header = FALSE, sep = " ", nrows = 10)
    c_Classes   <- sapply(dt_Training,  class)
    dt_Training <- fread(data_Training, header = FALSE, sep = " ", colClasses = c_Classes)
    
    dt_Testing  <- fread(data_Testing, header = FALSE, sep = " ", nrows = 10)
    c_Classes   <- sapply(dt_Testing,  class)
    dt_Testing  <- fread(data_Testing, header = FALSE, sep = " ", colClasses = c_Classes)

    # load the variable names and assign that to the columns.
    # Use read.csv here as we are going to subset the cols -> data.table NoGo
    df_features <- read.csv("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", header = FALSE, sep = " ")
    
    # Assign as column names
    colnames(dt_Testing)  <- as.character(df_features[,2])
    colnames(dt_Training) <- as.character(df_features[,2])
    
    # Is there a need to clean the data?
    # nrow(dt_Testing[!complete.cases(dt_Testing),])
    # nrow(dt_Training[!complete.cases(dt_Training),])
    
    # Merge the two data sets
    dt_merged <- rbind(dt_Testing,dt_Training)
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
